- [ ] Figure out if Mustache templates are enough to support UI. If not then find an alternative quickly
- [ ] refactor modules for people and groups so that the web configuration like base_url can flow through the app. This could be done by making a app_group and app_people object that held the various handlers. It could also be done through the config module exposing global values. Not sure right approach.
- [ ] Figure out how to render TypeScript to JavaScript for browser side interactivity if there is time to implement that
