# COLD UI

This project implemented the human user interface for [cold](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/cold). It is implemented in TypeScript, compiled into an executable via [Deno](https://deno.land). It is intended to run as a service behind the [Newt](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/newt) data router.

## Development Requirements

- [Deno](https://deno.land) >= 1.44
- [COLD](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/cold), latest release providing the data API JSON API
